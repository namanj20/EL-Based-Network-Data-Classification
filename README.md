# EL-Base-Network-Data-Classification
Research Work in the Domain of Smart Security to improve human life expectancy in an Autonomous Smart Home network.

We utilised a subset of the diverse yet realistice ACI IoT Network Traffic Dataset monitoring a setup mimicking real-life smart homes.

Through in-depth pre-processing and fine-tuning of parameters we proposed a 3 layer system model equiped with DL detection layer to correctly classify numerous malicious data.

Further, the DL layer comprised of a 1D CNN Model, put through rigorous testing with different optimizers and exhaustive evaluation of the results through various metrics.
