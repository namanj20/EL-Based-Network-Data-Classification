# EL-Based-Network-Data-Classification
Research Work in the Domain of Networks to effectively classify data and use SDN clustering in Smart Grids.

Through in-depth pre-processing and fine-tuning of parameters we proposed a 3 layer system model equiped with EL classifiication layer to correctly classify various types of network data.

Further, the EL layer comprised of a 8 different ML Classification models evaluated using multiple metrics.

Perfect parameters for all ML models were determined through the use of GridSearchCV.
